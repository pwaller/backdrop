    Scenario: for an authority get weekly data for the top 3 licences between two points in time
         when I go to "/licensing?group_by=licenceUrlSlug&filter_by=authorityUrlSlug:testport&start_at=2013-01-28T00:00:00%2B00:00&end_at=2013-03-29T00:00:00%2B00:00&period=week&collect=authorityName&collect=licenceName&sort_by=_count:descending&limit=3"
         then I should get back a status of "200"
          and the JSON should have "3" results
          and the "1st" result should have "licenceUrlSlug" equaling "fake-licence-3"
          and the "1st" result should have "values" with item with entries "{"_start_at":"2013-01-28T00:00:00+00:00","_end_at":"2013-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","_count":2}"
